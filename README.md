Computer Graphics Fractals

Summary: This project is about creating graphically beautiful fractals.

My first computer graphics project! 
Getting familiar with the school graphical library (MLX42), I learned about 
window and image management, optimization in computer graphics and got to practise event handling.
I also discovered the concept of fractals and complex numbers.

Score 125/100

To use, first download MLX42 Library:
--> make mlx
--> make

Availabe fractals:
- mandelbrot (m)
- julia (j)
- burning ship (b)

To navigate:
- zoom to mouse position with scroll
- zoom to the center with enter (in) and backspace (out) 
- use arrow keys to move the fractal
- close with ESC or click the x on window.

Clicking on the fractal will give you the coordniates and use them as input for Julia.
